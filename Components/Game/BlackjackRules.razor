    <h2>Blackjack Rules</h2>
    <ol class="blackjack-rules">
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">1</span>
            <p>The goal is to get a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">2</span>
            <p>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">3</span>
            <p>The player is dealt two cards initially. They can then choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">4</span>
            <p>If the player's first two cards have the same value, they can "split" them into two separate hands, each with its own bet equal to the original bet. The player then plays each hand independently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">5</span>
            <p>Players can "double down" on their first two cards, doubling their bet and receiving one additional card.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">6</span>
            <p>If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the round.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">7</span>
            <p>After the player completes their turn, the dealer reveals their hidden card and draws cards until their hand is worth at least 17 points.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">8</span>
            <p>If the dealer busts, the player wins. If neither busts, the hand with a value closest to 21 wins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="rule-number">9</span>
            <p>Blackjack (an ace and a 10-point card) beats any other 21-point hand.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
